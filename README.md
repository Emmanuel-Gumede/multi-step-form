## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SASS (SCSS)

### What I learned

In this project I learned a lot about HTML forms, especially designing and styling input elements such as checkboxes and radio buttons. I had a lot of fun manipulating the traditional look of these input elements, by adding images, titles and notes as well as resizing and positioning these on the form itself.

I also enjoyed doing this project with React. I learnt a lot of React tricks such as switching pages, re-using repeatitive components as well as handling props.

### Continued development

In this project, I realized that planning for a project like this is paramount important. I therefore intend to develop project planning skills in all my future projects. I am also a newbie with SASS and it is my goal to continue developing my knowledge and skill using this wonderfull CSS tool. Lastly, I am still focusing on learning React library.

### Useful resources

- [React JavaScript Library](https://reactjs.org/) - This is the official website for React library. I always have this website open in case I run into some issues while using this library.
- [SCSS CSS Extention](https://sass-lang.com/) - This is the official website for SCSS. The documentation section contains tons of useful examples.
